# Ashley Wagner Individual Project

### Problem Statement

For those who find pleasure in storytelling, WattPad provides a place to both publish one's own stories and partake in 
the stories of others around the world. The website plays host to a wide selection of genres, but the linear fashion in which
the user is forced to progress through these stories makes it difficult to share and consume those of one genre in 
particular: choose-your-own-adventure. IndieProject would be built with the non-linear nature of these stories in mind, 
allowing the users to both create and interact with stories in which their choices matter, and in a way that is intuitive and 
enjoyable.
