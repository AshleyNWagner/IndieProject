# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, 
as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.


### Week 4

2/14/2022 -  around 10 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Designed screens
* Wrote user stories
* Wrote Project Plan

I only just realized I was supposed to be writing weekly reflections, so I'm starting with week 4. The weekly work went well,
for the most part. The indie project checkpoint was the biggest challenge of the week simply because it can be difficult 
to refine vague project ideas into a concrete, detailed plan/design, though I'm glad to now have a better idea of what I 
want to accomplish over the course of the semester.

### Week 5

2/20/2022 - hours
