# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.


### Week 4

I only just realized I was supposed to be writing weekly reflections, so I'm starting with week 4. I'll be updating
this once the week is over.
